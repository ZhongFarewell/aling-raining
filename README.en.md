#### Introduction
This is a collection of "quirky" component libraries I've developed during my work. Examples include a button and upload functionality styled after the WeChat Moments interface, as well as a form component, AForm, with preconfigured features.

#### Software Architecture
These components are built on top of antd and antd-mobile, fully compatible with the original antd component props while adding some additional props. The styling scheme is based on Cij, and the library used is Mui.
